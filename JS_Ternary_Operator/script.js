// If your country's population is greater than 33 million, use the ternary operator to log a string like this to the console: "Portugal's population is above average". Otherwise, simply log "Portugal's population is below average". Notice how only one word change between these two sentences!

// After checking the result, change the population temporarily to 13 and then to 130. See the different results, and set the population back to original.

const mexicoPopulation = 130000000;
const averagePopulation = 33000000;
const message = mexicoPopulation >= averagePopulation ? 'Mexican population is above average' : 'Mexican population is below average';
console.log(population);
